These directories contain the results output by EPPSEA and published in the thesis, for experiments 1, 2, and 3. See the thesis for more information on these experiments.

Note that these directories do not contain any of the raw data output by the pickling functions in EPPSEA, as these were prohibitively large. Running EPPSEA with the configuratinos provided in these results should be sufficient to recreate this data.
