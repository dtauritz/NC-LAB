This directory contains the work done by Samuel Richter on the "Evolved Parameterized Selection Functions for Evolutionary Algorithms" (EPPESA) project, previously known as "Evolved Parameterized Probabilistic Selection Functions for Evolutionary Algorithms" and "Automated Design of Probabilistic Selection Methods for Evolutionary Algorithms".

The 'code' directory contains the code and configuration files for EPPSEA.

The 'papers' directory contains the papers published during the project, as well as Latex source to build them.

The 'results' directory contains the results of the runs that were published in the final thesis.
